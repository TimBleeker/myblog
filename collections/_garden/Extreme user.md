excerpt: "A type of user"

I learned about this term from Jack Strachan's 2017 Medium article ["Why use extreme users"](https://uxplanet.org/why-use-extreme-users-345e97719e52), though it might have originated somewhere else.

- An extreme user is a person who uses a system with amplified needs. They may want or need less or more of something to solve their problems.
- They may resort to workarounds or [[Folk interface]]s to solve their problems, unlike average users
- They might be early adopters without realizing it

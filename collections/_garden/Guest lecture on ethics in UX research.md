### Notes for John
- ~~I have the vague assumption that this course is very much about ethical challenges *in* or *through* ethnographic research. While thinking about my talk, I organically landed in the area of ethical challenges *solved by* ethnographic research. I don't know if that's even something you're interested in. Please let me know.~~
- ~~I could easily fill 30 minutes on this talk setup. There's a little bit of interaction up front, because I'd want to get a sense of what their perspectives are on this method.~~

### Talk setup
- Title: Ethnographic research as a vehicle for ethical product development
- Setting the scene
	- Optional questions for students:
		- Sell me on ethnographic research for my project
		- Why should product developers conduct ethnographic research?
		- Why shouldn't they?
		- What does research mean to you?
		- What do you think research means to my work?
- Introducing myself
	- Expertise
		- Enterprise SaaS
		- Soft and hard research data
		- UX ranges from "talking to users" to "on-site digital ethnography", I'm in between: use words that stakeholders will understand
	- Experience
	- Relevance: thinking broadly about research
- Today: 
	- How I use ethnographic research in my work practice
	- How ethnographic research helps product companies be more ethical
	- Lowkey pitch: anthropologists make amazing UXers (what is “proper” research)
- Contextualizing ethnographic research in UX
	- Designers kind of know what they’re doing
	- Nobody I know calls it ethnographic research (far removed from origins)
	- Means to an end (cutting corners)
	- I don’t know what I’m talking about
- Case study: building a UXR practice in an educational technology startup
	- Startup trajectory: from pizza nights to little UX
	- Case study:
		- Ed tech startup
			- Vision: more equitable primary education
			- Offering:
				- Dashboard
				- Training
				- Consulting
		- Org chart
			- Startup to enterprise (consultants)
			- Early days vs now (from pizza night to everybody “talks to users”)
		- Challenges: scalability, sustainability, lack of maturity (picking methods vs. "talking to users")
			- Ethical problem: “Users are dumb” (we don’t know how to ask questions)
			- Ethical problem: “Users are dumb” (we don’t understand what the role of an ex-techer should be)
			- Unbalanced product management geared towards business and theoretical educational improvements
			- Poor product market fit
		- Opportunities: 
			- Principles: Proper research, accessibility (evangelism), atomic, continuous
			- Identifying touchpoints for recruitment (sales funnel, dashboard, churn, consulting, support, social media)
		- Benchmarking:
			- Which schools are "healthy customers", what do they have in common?
			- UXers using research methods accordingly
				- Ethnographic research: research planning makes it more ethical
			- Coaching non-researchers in research
		- Results:
			- Grew seniority of designers
			- Fostered a culture of informed opinions
			- Better advocating for users
			- Research as a tool for stakeholder management

### Notes for Zinzy
- There are two gripes that I seem to be playing with here:
	- product can't do without UX
	- UX can't do without anthropology
	- It's probably best to keep it clean and cut the second
### Initial ideas
- What steps do we take to ensure our research is ethical?
- What ethical challenges are produced by research?
- What ethical challenges are produced by a lack of research?
	- Thinking *for* users
	- Operating on the assumption that users can't tell us what they want because we don't use the appropriate methods
	- Enterprise UX lends itself to unethical product practices by installing consultants to act on behalf of users, as "smarter, better informed, better educated" versions of them
- Getting buy-in for ethnographic research is difficult in enterprise SaaS because subject matter experts "get in the way" ("research for the sake of research")
- What ethical challenges can impact-driven startups run into (while thinking they're ethical by virtue of impact-driven nature?)

### Thoughts I won't include but want to remember
- Le Guin's story reminds me so much of what happens in Big Tech: looking at it from the outside, it seems as though designers either drink the Kool-Aid or walk away entirely. Does anybody stay and fight?

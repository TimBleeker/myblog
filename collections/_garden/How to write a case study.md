Writing case studies is one of the best ways for me to zoom out and look at what I've accomplished in my professional life. Here are some best practices I've been using.

### Write case studies when you don't need them
I am well familiar with the dread of having to put together a design portfolio. It's exciting once it's live, but up until that point, it feels as though I'm a house painter, and my prospective clients come to my house to assess how well I've done. I do my best to write case studies periodically, picking interesting features or processes in which I've been involved recently.

### Tell a compelling story
Rather than working to fill sections with technical and practical information ("this was my role in the team", "I used these methods"), I do my best to embed this content in a broader story. I don't typically use the headings listed below, but these are the elements that make up any case study I write:

- **Background:** things were giong great until we realized there was a problem for our customers
- **Conflict**: this is the first time I've ever done something like this, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to do everything
- **Rising action**: I tried many things, failed a bunch. I learned how important it is to continually iterate, get stakeholder feedback, and involve engineering early in the process
- **Climax**: I wasn't sure if we'd make it, but we did and it was a success
- **Failing action**: by involving engineering early, we side-stepped a massive problem and forged new bonds for future projects
- **Resolution**: the solution we built has been receiving mostly positive feedback from customers. We'll be iterating soon...

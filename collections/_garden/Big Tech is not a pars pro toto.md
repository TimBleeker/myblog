One [[Pars pro toto]] that has come into popularity in at least the past decade is the manner in which tech workers refer to Big Tech professionals as the better, more organized, more successful, and more forward-thinking versions of themselves. 

I find this worrisome.

A designer I collaborated with recently, in explaining why she had taken a particular approach to solving a problem, confidently said "well, my mentor said this is how it's done, and she works at a FAANG company, you know, so..." She didn't continue the sentence, but it was implied that, because this mentor worked at an internationally-recognized company, she must have the answer to the problem.

As a designer specialized in [[Concepts/Enterprise UX]], my working life couldn't be more different from Big Tech companies: I am usually one of only a handful of designers in a department, often at a company employing many consultants who unwittingly "do UX" as part of their account management. The vast majority of my colleagues hadn't worked with a UX professional until they joined the company. 

Before my UX colleagues and I get to do any actual work, there's a steep, steep mountain of UX evangelism we need to climb. The mountain becomes less steep as time goes on, but it's always there, taking us aback and making us say to ourselves and each other "wow, still?!"

In my world, there's no need for the term "unicorn", because it's all part of the normal job description. I don't get to specialize in one particular aspect of UX, but instead service my company with any type of UX design or research activity necessary to solve a problem.

All of this requires a mindset of a patience, empathy and understanding, and out-of-the-box thinking that is best fostered in an environment that keeps telling designers they're not needed. Designers whose careers consist of roles at Big Tech companies can't possibly know what I'm talking about.

And that's okay, everybody has their place in the world. But it seems the industry doesn't see it that way. And neither does that designer I mentioned earlier. 

It makes for wonky collaboration, in which phrases like "I want us to be the next Instagram" are normal.

Big Tech companies that employ 300+ designers don't provide that context.

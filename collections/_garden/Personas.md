A UX persona is a fictional character which represents (a subset of) users of a product. It's not the average of all these users, but rather a realistic profile of a typical person in the group. 

I use personas in various areas of my work as a  [[My Second Brain/Enterprise UX]] designer. I've found that both the creation and use of personas can help us to collaborate more closely and to [[My Second Brain/Foreground assumptions]].

### Personas of people at work
Designers working in Enterprise SaaS may have a special interest in personas because of the way their company might be organized. Such companies may well have a solid user-centered outlook, but may underuse UX professionals on staff when it comes to identifying user needs. This is not wrong: the ones who *are* tasked with identifying those needs will be seasoned professionals who come from the same industry as the user base. 

### Persona building blocks
- Hard facts
- Interests
- Values
- Technology proficiency
- Typical day, user tasks
- Goals
- Frustrations


### Building a persona
I usually start building personas in a setting that is as interdisciplinary as possible. First and foremost, I've found it's a great way to help foster alignment among stakeholders.

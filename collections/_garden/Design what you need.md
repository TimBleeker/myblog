As designers, one of the best skills we can develop is to choose our design deliverables carefully. Junior or medior designers, laser-focused on creating the best possible interface and interaction design at all cost, may have a habit of creating high-fidelity, clickable prototypes covering every part of a user flow. The reasoning here, I've found, may be that this type of deliverable best communicates the nuances and intricacies of a design. 

Throughout [my design journey](/work) I've come to see design as a collection of dialects: a set of different ways of speaking to a person or group of people in a way that best suits the purpose of the conversation. This way, the design I make to test a concept with users may differ greatly from what that same design would look like as a hand-off to developers.

### Example

#### Ideate
- Collaborate with stakeholders using wireframes
- Codesign session with users using whiteboard

#### Prototype
- Various personas in user test (design for lowest threshold: high-fidelity prototypes)
- No click events beyond the basic click-through, because the test doesn't aim to answer interactive questions, but rather comprehension questions

#### Hand-off
- Existing elements all in place, very basic wireframe
- Hifi for the new component, because we're adding a new library

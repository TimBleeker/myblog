As an advocate of plain-text densely-linked notes, I have the difficult task of deciding what taxonomy and hierarchy will underpin my notes collection. Within my tool of choice, [[Obsidian]], I have the option to use actual `#tag`s, as well as linked notes that can serve as organizers. 

Currently, I use the following principles in structuring my work:
- To best learn about the hidden connections in my writing, I let the text speak for itself as much ad possible. This means that, if I can, I don’t use a traditional tag such as  `#psychology`. 
- Instead, I’ll create a link to `[[Psychology]]`, which or may not already be a page. Using the [[Obsidian Graph]] functionality, structure  will naturally emerge, and I can identify themes that I apparently mention frequently but which don’t have a page yet.
- The primary way in which I use tags is to identify particular kinds of notes; ones I need to visualize productivity or information in a particular way. I use `#project/active` and `#project/inactive` to organize my commitments. The `#person` tag helps me collect [[Notes on people]], their contact and birthday informations, etc. 
- Another purpose for tags in my notes collection is to assign attributes to my day, which I use as part of mt [[Self-tracking]]. I use `#feel/happy` and `#feel/anxious` in my daily logging, and `#sleep/good` and  `#dream/weird` to classify my nocturnal adventures. 

I’ve always struggled to define a solid course of action for my tagging hygiene. [This comment on the Obsidian forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/how-to-use-tags/35320/14) helped me see that I really only use functional tags. My bottom-up approach for letting topics emerge through dense linking is entirely inspired by [Artem Kirsanov’s video detailing his Obsidian setup](https://youtu.be/E6ySG7xYgjY).

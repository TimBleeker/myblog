Everyone I know has a strong opinion on Amsterdam. There's no "meh, whatever". People either love it or love to leave it. Some reasons I know people love Amsterdam: access to cultural events and places, big city many people, things *happen* here.

I love Amsterdam because of how I fit in here. Having grown up in the southern countryside, I love that, as a fat queer person of color, I don't really stand out in this city. People mind their business, but not so much that I feel isolated. 

### My favorite places
A wide collection of spots in Amsterdam that I love can be found in [Zinzy's Amsterdam](https://goo.gl/maps/j9okcKskjJvxhd2a9), a Google Maps list.

### Fun facts
- Sometimes in the morning when you're biking to work, you might find that the air in Amsterdam smells like dark chocolate powder. It's most likely the [chocolate factory in Zaandam](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/oct/07/smell-amsterdam-cannabis-odour-mappers-kate-mclean).
- When I'm abroad and I smell the scent of weed, I am hit with a bout of strong nostalgia for the city. When I'm home and I smell it, I feel disdain.

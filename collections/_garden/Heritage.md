I think about heritage whenever I see someone’s impressive genealogical research. As an [[Afropean]] person, I struggle to make sense of what my heritage is. 

This I know for sure:
- My mother is Dutch, born in the South of the Netherlands to a woman from Voorschoten and a man from Roermond
- My father is São Toméan

I know how to trace some of my maternal genealogy, but for my paternal lineage it’s more difficult.

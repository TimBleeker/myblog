In personal knowledge management, contact information might not be the first thing I think to document. After all, between my phone, Google, and the Mac OS X Contacts app, I figure I’ll always be able to find what I need. 

Until I don’t. 

Following my personal principle that [[Information should be made to last]], I have been using [[Obsidian]] to collect information on the people in my life. The system contains standard information such as address details, but also their birthday, gifts that we’ve exchanged, and other details that I may find important.

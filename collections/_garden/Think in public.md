Thinking in public has been a thing on the Internet since the first website, although in recent years a less performative form of the practice has gained in popularity.

Rather than mulling over blog posts for weeks on end, and finetuning anything we publish on the Internet, we may consider publishing drafts, unifinished thoughts, things we haven't figured out yet. 

Thinking in public is suitable for any type of web publishing, but seems to lend itself particularly to personal websites that are constructed as digital gardens.

excerpt: "A problem phenomenon"

A wicked problem is a challenge with so many interdependent factors that it seems impossible to solve.[^1] It originated in social planning.[^2]

I've found that [[Concepts/Enterprise UX]] is a particularly good platform for such problems to fester. Generative research might surface a problem, and soon it appears that there are other problems that are very closely related to it. Before you know it, one feature request has turned into a six-month research project.

I'm referring in particular to those enterprise SaaS products that cater to a niche market. I consider "general" tools such as Atlassian's product suite, Notion, Google Workspace of a different category here. Rather, I'm referring to niche dashboard products used by a specific type of professional to solve problems at work.

The danger of wicked problems is that they might create analysis paralysis. I've seen many product people (myself included) lose the forest for the trees. It's important to keep the conversation in a team open enough that we can [[Make a decision]].

An explanation of this term I also like is "a problem whose [social complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_complexity "Social complexity") means that it has no determinable stopping point".[^3]

To a certain extent, I wonder whether perceiving something as a wicked problem is indicative of a lack of understanding.

Information is useless if I manage it in such a way that I’ll lose it. Before, this note was called something like “tools don’t matter”, or some other phrasing that emphasized [[tool agnosticism]]. In hindsight, that wasn’t the right way to describe my thoughts. After all, tools really *do* matter to me. It’s when they no longer do that I’m reminded that information should be made to last. 

When I say this, I mean that I want my information, the insights I derive from sources and experiences, to be available regardless of the tool I chose to use it with. If a platform decides it can no longer exist, I don’t want my data to go down with it, as happened with many [site deaths](https://indieweb.org/site-deaths) in the past. 

Dan Russell articulated this well in his [2013 *How I Work* interview with Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/im-dan-russell-google-research-scientist-and-this-is-1450690468):

> But you could take everything away except a loincloth and I could reboot my work environment in just an hour or so with a decent internet connection, any laptop, and a stationary store.

Handling information in such a way that it’s made to last helps me learn deeply about all sorts of things. It helps me see connections where I thought they didn’t exist. It helps me see how I’ve developed as a human. It helps me remember what life was like for me 15 years ago. It’s not uncommon for me to come across song lyrics I wrote when I was 20, and for me to remember melody as soon as I read the words. 

These are a few principles that help me make things to last:
- Write and store information in plain text, platform-independent `.md` or `.txt` files 
- Use applications that can read the contents of a folder in my operating system, a folder which I can manipulate, move, or archive at will. Don’t use applications that only support cloud-based data management such as Roam or Notion.
- If needed, save a link using the [web archive functionality](https://help.archive.org/help/save-pages-in-the-wayback-machine/#:~:text=Go%20to%20a%20page%20you,give%20you%20a%20permanent%20URL.)
-  Don’t leave a trace. I aim to include as few application- or functionality-specific configurations in my notes, content that becomes obsolete as soon as I switch tools. (I’ve made on exception for [alternate checkboxes](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal#alternate-checkboxes), which I use in my daily notes to track tasks, priorities, and experiences)

I went to see this film on [[2022-05-06]], thinking it would be a bit of a boring [[Rom-com]]. I couldn't have been more wrong, but I'm chalking it up to my lack of exposure to [[Art house cinema]] during [[the Pandemic]]. I've seen it in the theatre three times so far, and it might be my favorite film of the year.

The story of Ali and Ava lingers like a [[Zadie Smith]] novel. It's kind, newly sincere, and quiet. There's something very refreshing about seeing a story of love play out across ethnic and cultural differences without the whole thing falling into the type of racial tensions particular to the context of the [[United States]]. It's an unromcom.

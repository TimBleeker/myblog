Since July of 2023, if you’re hoping to interact with me on a topic that might be particularly difficult for me, I may send out a payment request for an emotional labor fee. 

Let me elaborate. 

A standard-issue part of my life is being approached by people who want to talk to me about today’s hot button issues: racism, pronouns, and gender diversity. I call the part of life “standard-issue” because the way people start them, talk during them, and end them are the same. 

A conversation may start like this:
- “I have a question and you might actually *really* be able to help me out with this: what do you think of the fact that my timeline is full of X?”
- “I really love that people are standing up against X but you can’t see anything anymore these days….”

Please note the pattern here: 
- Each of these examples is an invitation to connect and share
- They both start with something position, either about me or about the general state of things 
- Each leave a silence for me to justify X
- X could be any topic the designated community of which I can represent: racism, sexual and gender diversity, pronoun use

Conversations like this might also include [[Cat whisper]]s, 



I’ve been carrying around a trump card that is helping me overcome complex trauma that had been with me the majority of my life. 


Lately, I've been experimenting with what started out as a hilarious joke and is gradually becoming a healing tool in my experience with complex trauma.

The emotional labor fee is a payment request sent out via phone (Venmo for American readers, Tikkie for Dutch readers, to all the other readers: I have no idea what you use and I apologize). It helps me what has always seemed impossible when people would broach the subject of discrimination: pause and think "do I want this?"

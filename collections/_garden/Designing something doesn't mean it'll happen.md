_This is an early-stage note._

- Some designers have the misconception that if they design something, it'll happen.
- They may expect that, because something is reflected in a design hand-off file, developers will pick up on it.
- It may be a way for designers to implement changes without receiving sign-off for them. This is an example of [[Feature sneak]].
- In other cases, designers might simply not be aware of [[How to hand off a design]].

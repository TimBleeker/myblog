excerpt: "An ethical concept"

I believe very strongly that, whatever the ethical framework to which a human has been subjected, in the depth of their heart they will want to do what they think will make the world a better place. 

As an superminority[^1], I do well to remember this. It helps me better navigate social contexts in which people might do or say things that are unintendedly harmful. For me, this maxim invokes the atmosphere of first learning about [[Standpoint theory]] in university, of reading Kimberl√© Crenshaw's work on [[Intersectionality]]. Everybody is their own intersection, some are very different from mine, and that's okay.

When I say this to myself, I don't do so to justify harmful behavior, but to better frame the conversation I may be having around it.

### Notes
- [[Categorische imperatief]]?


[^1]: My friend Mark sometimes tells me about his friend who is a producer in Irish television, who would always say "if only I can find a Black lesbian in a wheelchair". I, too, sometimes joke about the number of minority groups to which I belong. I don't often use "superminority", but I like that, when I googled it, [this definition](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/superminority) came up (I relate to number 7 on the list).

A coping strategy that people use to the effects of prolonged exposure to stress induced by discrimination or racism; it may result in a variety of physiological costs. It was coined in the 1970s by epidemiologist and public health researcher Sherman James in his efforts to investigate health disparities between Black people and others in North Carolina.

The term refers to John Henry Martin, a former enslaved man whose efforts to improve the lives of him and his family came at great physiological costs. His circumstances and struggles were evocative of folk hero [John Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_(folklore)).

I first read about this term in Claudia Rankine's [[Citizen (2015)]].

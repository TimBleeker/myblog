Used both in a broad sense and as a specific method, design thinking embodies a wealth of ideas on how designers (should) think, and how this way of thinking can be employed by non-designers. The term was first mentioned in Herbert A. Simon's 1969 _The Sciences of the Artificial_. This note focuses on the method.

Design Thinking is a non-linear, iterative process[^1] consisting of five stages during which individuals or teams work to understand users and their challenges, foreground and challenge assumptions within the organization, (re)define problems, and create solutions that are prototyped and tested. The process is particularly well-suited for solving [[My Second Brain/3. Resources/Concepts/Wicked problem]]s. It's a form of [[Solution-based thinking]].

### 4 principles of design thinking[^2]
Christoph Meinel and Harry Leifel of StanfordÂ Hasso-Plattner-Institute of Design defined four principles of this process:
1. **The human rule**: all design activity is social in nature
2. **The ambiguity rule**: ambiguity is inevitable, designers are encouraged to experiment at the limits of their knowledge
3. **All design is redesign**: whie technology and social circumstances may change, basic human needs remain unchanged
4. **The tangibility rule**: prototypes help to make ideas tangible, enabling designers to communicate them effectively

### The five stages

#### Stage 1: Empathize
- Purpose: gather data about users, behaviors, desires, and needs; their [[Concepts/Pains and gains]]
- Best practice: [[Concepts/Foreground assumptions]] and challenge them
- Activities: [[Contextual inquiry]], [[Customer feedback analysis]], [[Field studies]], [[Focus group]], [[Job analysis]], [[Stakeholder interview]] (to gather assumptions), [[Task analysis]], and [[User interview]]. 

In addition, researchers benefit from taking a [[Learner's mentality]] and a [[Beginner's mindset]], as well as remember that [[The best way to learn is by allowing yourself to look stupid]]. If the existing understanding of users has become somewhat of an average monolith, it's best to involve [[Concepts/Extreme user]]s.

#### Stage 2: Define
My working principles of this stage are holistic thinking, decisiveness, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

Once data has been collected, the _Define_ stage is more convergent in nature, and focuses on turning the raw data into synthesized tools that can drive ideation. Here, we make sense of what we've learnt. The end of this stage is marked by a clearly defined problem statement. A best practice is to pair this problem with research deliverables that you can use later on to reignite an empathic approach to users.

Instead of focusing only on the negative sides of the problems, we focus on the opportunities the problems give us. It's our way of shaping a point of view about the problems in a user-centered way. Appropriate activities in this stage are [[Concepts/UX Toolkit#^715895|various kinds of workshops]].

Next to a [[Problem statement]], primary deliverables could be [[Jobs-to-be-done]]. 
Additional deliverables include [[Customer journey map]], [[Ecosystem map]], [[Empathy map]], [[Mental model diagram]], [[Task analysis diagram]], and [[Concepts/Personas]].

#### Stage 3: Ideate
Again, we return to a divergent stage to begin working on potential solutions. This is where a lot of designers feel most creative, and because of this, it's important to consider it a judgement-free zone. Using [[Divergent thinking]] techniques,
